                  Many current sales catalogs from Christie's, Sotheby's, Bonham's, Phillips, Swann, William Doyle and others have been boxed by city and date and are mostly off-site out at ReCAP (browse below). \
                  These require 1-2 business days' notice at least and up to a week if many catalogs are needed. Marquand has many more catalogs from c. 1820s-1990s for more than 250 auction houses, both cataloged and un-cataloged. \
                  Book and coin sales, unless mixed content, are handled by Special Collections in Firestone Library.</p>`
